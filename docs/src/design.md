## The problem we want to solve

### A common case

Alice is user new to quantum computing. She is familiar with the Python
programming language. And she wants to try some algorithms implemented in Julia.

Bob is a quantum computing package developer. The package is written in Julia
and he wants to have more users to try it out without learning the
implementation details.
