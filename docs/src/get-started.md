# Get started

Jugsaw users are categorized into the following types.
A different start up guide is prepared for each type of users.

* A developer can register a Jugsaw app on the Jugsaw website through Github Actions ([get started](developer.md)). A Jugsaw app must be written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) or contained in a Julia wrapper.
* End users (including the developer himself) access the Jugsaw app through the application web page or multi-language clients. The list of supported client languages include
    * Julia ([get started](client-julia.md))
    * Python([get started](client-python.md))
    * Javascript([get started](client-javascript.md))
