# Jugsaw


[Jugsaw](https://www.jugsaw.co) is a toolkit designed to assist scientific computing scientists in deploying their applications to the cloud. Applications are deployed on the Jugsaw website as Jugsaw apps, which consist of a set of functions.


!!! note
    Currently, these functions must be written in Julia or encapsulated within a [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) wrapper ([C, Fortran](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/calling-c-and-fortran-code/), [Python](https://github.com/cjdoris/PythonCall.jl)).
